Description: This package includes the MATLAB codes for“Fast Multiplicative Algorithms for Symmetric Nonnegative Tensor Factorization”，
and it contains the following files:

README.txt
Demo_SyntheticData.m
Demo_lineClustring.m
Demo_ImageClustering.m
Demo_HyperStochasticNorm.m
alpha_Paralle_Multi_SNCP.m
beta_Paralle_Multi_SNCP.m
HyperStochasticTensor.m
nearestHS.m
AC_MIhat.m
similarity.m
loadsub.m

Users need to include the tensor_toolbox_2.5, which is available in http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/, 
and other three files ("bestMap.m",  "hungarian.m" and "MutualInfo.m"), which are available in http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/Clustering.html,
into the present working directory before running the above files.
